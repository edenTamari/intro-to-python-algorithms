### Intro to Python Algorithms

This project contains several fundamental algorithmic exercises implemented in Python, including search algorithms, recursion, and string/list manipulation.  
It was developed as part of an academic Python and Data Science course.

### Exercises Included

- **find_missing_item_v1** – Finds the missing item in an arithmetic series using linear scan.
- **find_missing_item_v2** – Same as above, optimized using binary search.
- **split_list_index** – Finds an index that splits a list into two parts with equal sums.
- **max_sequence** – Recursively finds the longest valid number sequence based on digit transitions.
- **order** – Recursively merges two sorted strings into one sorted string.

### Testing

This project includes a `tester.py` file with sample test cases.  
To run the tests:

```bash
python tester.py
